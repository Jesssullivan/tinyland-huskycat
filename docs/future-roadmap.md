# HuskyCat Future Roadmap ## E2E Testing Goals (Removed from v2.0) The following E2E testing capabilities were removed from the current release as they were aspirational and not yet ready for implementation. They remain as future goals for the project. ### 1. GitLab Pages Deployment Testing **Target:** v3.0 - **Goal:** Automated testing of GitLab Pages deployment at https://huskycat.pages.io - **Components:** - Verify documentation site accessibility - Test MkDocs navigation and content - Validate download links and installation scripts - Browser-based testing with Playwright ### 2. MCP Server Integration Testing **Target:** v2.5 - **Goal:** Comprehensive E2E testing of MCP (Model Context Protocol) server - **Components:** - Stdio-based JSON-RPC protocol validation - Multi-client connection testing - Validation service integration tests - Performance benchmarking under load ### 3. CI/CD Pipeline E2E Testing **Target:** v2.5 - **Goal:** Full pipeline execution testing - **Components:** - GitLab CI YAML validation - GitHub Actions workflow testing - Cross-platform container builds - Deployment pipeline verification ## Implementation Requirements Before implementing E2E tests, the following prerequisites must be met: 1. **Infrastructure:** - Stable GitLab Pages deployment - Production MCP server endpoint - Test environment isolation 2. **Dependencies:** - Playwright for browser automation - pytest-playwright for test integration - pytest-html for report generation - pytest-cov for coverage tracking 3. **Test Data:** - Sample repositories for validation - Mock MCP client implementations - CI/CD pipeline fixtures ## Removed Test Files The following test files were removed and should be recreated when implementing E2E tests: - `tests/e2e/test_pages_deployment.py` - `tests/e2e/test_mcp_integration.py` - `tests/e2e/test_ci_cd_pipeline.py` - `tests/e2e/run_e2e_tests.py` - `tests/e2e/fixtures.py` - `tests/playwright.config.py` ## GitLab CI Jobs Removed The following CI jobs were removed from `.gitlab-ci.yml`: - `test:e2e:comprehensive` - `test:e2e:playwright` These jobs attempted to run Playwright-based browser tests but were failing due to the aspirational nature of the tests. ## Notes E2E tests were removed in commit [pending] as they were testing functionality that doesn't yet exist (GitLab Pages at huskycat.pages.io, full MCP server deployment, etc.). They should be reintroduced once the actual services are deployed and stable.
